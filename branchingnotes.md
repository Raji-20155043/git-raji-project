# Add steps for Branching and Merging

1. git branch "branchname" (command) - "branchname" - name for your new branch 
    origin branch will be master
2. git log (command) - check the log events and the header statement will be 
    (HEAD -> master, branch-merge) or (HEAD -> master, origin/master, branch-merge) -- branch-merge is the new baranch name
3. git checkout newbranchname (branch-merge) (command) - It will be switched to new branch called "branch-merge"    
    from master
4. create a new file and write down
5. Commit the new file
    git add . (command) - adding the files
    git commit -m "message"  (command) - new file committed
    git log (command) - to see the log events
